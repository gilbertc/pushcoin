Welcome Developers
==================

Before going through the code, consider visiting the PUSHCOiN developer 
site: https://pushcoin.com/Pub/SDK/WelcomeDevelopers

This README provides an overview of the PUSHCOiN repository. 

At the top project-level, there is a directory per OS platform for which
the 'PUSHCOiN Mobile Application' has been ported to or is in the works.
You can also find numerous short examples or test-code, in various
programming languages, demonstrating key operational features of the 
platform.

Navigate to the platform or example that interest you. Try the code out. 
If you run into problems, visit PUSHCOiN developer forums 
(https://pushcoin.com/forum/) and seek help.
